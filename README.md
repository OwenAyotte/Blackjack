## General

Terminal based playable blackjack program. 

This program is the backbone on which a second program that simulates the performance of blackjack algorithms and evaluates them will be built upon.

Player actions are Hitting, Splitting, Doubling Down, and Standing. Insurance mechanics are not implemented. Dealer does not hit on soft 17s.

README.md will be fleshed out further in a later commit.

## Contributing

Contributions are unlikely to be accepted, unless a critical flaw is brought to my attention. This is a personal project, so I aim to make sure I am responcible for as much of the code as possible.
